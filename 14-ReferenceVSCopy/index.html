      //because the value of age2 is set before we changed the value of age, age2 will stay at 100

      // let age2 = age;

      // and we want to make a copy of it.

      // You might think we can just do something like this:
      team[3] = "team";
      console.log(players, team);
      /*this updates the original array*/

      // however what happens when we update that array?

      // now here is the problem!

      // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

      // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

      // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      // one way
      const team2 = players.slice();
      team2[3] = "team2"
      
      // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);
      team3[3] = "team3"
      
      // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];
      team4[3] = "team4"
      
      console.log(team2, team3, team4);
      
      team5 = Array.from(players)
      team5[3] = "team5"
      console.log(team5);
      // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed




      // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

      // with Objects
      const person = {
        name: "Wes Bos",
        age: 80,
      };

      // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      captain.number = 99

      console.log(person, captain)
      // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12});
      console.log(cap2);

      // ES6 update, using spread
      const cap3 = {...person};
      cap3.age = 57;
      console.log(cap3);
      // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
