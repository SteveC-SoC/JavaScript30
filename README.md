# JavaScript30  

## Aim  
Work through the [JavaScript 30 day challenge](https://javascript30.com/), this is to be completed by the end of June 2021 (today is 4/6/21).  
Code to be commented, to allow me to refer back to it in the future and to embed the knowledge, I don't want to just write the code, I want to understand it  

Let's get to it 😁  

## Progress
