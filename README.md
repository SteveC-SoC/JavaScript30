# JavaScript30  

## Aim  
Work through the [JavaScript 30 day challenge](https://javascript30.com/), this is to be completed by the end of June 2021 (today is 4/6/21).  
Code to be commented, to allow me to refer back to it in the future and to embed the knowledge, I don't want to just write the code, I want to understand it  

Let's get to it üòÅ

DEFINITIONS  

- Filter - The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).
- Map - The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order. Turn squares into circles
- Sort - The sort order can be either alphabetic or numeric, and either ascending (up) or descending (down).
- Reduce - The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.

05 - Flex Panel Gallery

- Tutorial completed ‚úî  
- flex:1 vs flex: 5, in CSS. one is equal spacing, five is five times the amount of room as the others  
- The :before/:after selector inserts something before/after the content of each selected element(s). [Example](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_before.asp)  
- can the this. be refactored, sure this is old JS  
- close one panel when another is opened

- .some checkes is ANY items in the array match the criteria

- .find returns the first item that matches the criteria
- BECAREFUL with the difference between "splice" and "slice"
- 
- The splice() method returns the removed items in an array. The slice() method returns the selected element(s) in an array, as a new array object. The splice() method CHANGES THE ORIGINAL ARRAY and slice() method DOESN'T CHANGE THE ORIGINAL ARRAY.
